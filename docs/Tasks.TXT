 - The wisdom of where to go is spreaded around the different pages, 
there is no need for a central/generic mechanism for going through pages
-. No need to handle Refresh in the right way (in middle of test)
-. each page has a התקדם button - there is no way to go back, and filling all inputs is required anywhere
